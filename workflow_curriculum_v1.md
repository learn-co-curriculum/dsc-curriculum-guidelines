# Workflow for Curriculum V1


## Step 1: Looking at the curriculum spreadsheet

Once assigned a section or brick to work on, look at the curriculum spreadsheet to

1. See to what extent there are existing lessons
2. Look at the "additional notes" column to look at the comments on what to change. In general, lines highlighted in blue denote that substantial changes are needed.

## Step 2: Creating new repositories

Depending on whether a lesson existed for Curriculum V0, you will 

1. Copy the existing repository into a new one following [these steps](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-curriculum-guidelines/blob/master/cloning_repositories.md).
2. Create a new repository according to the right format (repository structure guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-curriculum-guidelines/blob/master/lesson_repository_structure.md))

The new repository has a name starts with "dsc-", then a logical name depending on the lesson title eg, "intro-to-KNN". If a lab, the repo name ends with a suffix "-lab". 

## Step 3: Working on a lesson

The guidelines in this step are mostly important when working on reworking content (where a github repository pre-existed).

Before doing anything make sure to

1. Look at the curriculum spreadsheet and be aware of existing comments
2. Look at the pre-existing repository and see if any github issues were created

Next, make sure to review the and fix for the following main issues

1. Grammatical errors and typos: quick copy paste in a google doc should do the trick.
2. Plagiarism: we are aware of some of our contents being exact copies of pre-existing websites/blogs. Make sure to do due diligence and check for that.
3. Writing style: make sure to edit academic-sounding passages. Edit academic-sounding language ("shall"), and keep in mind that we want to write in a way that a high school student can understand our curriculum
4. 

## Step 4: Updating airtable

## intro and recap of section

(Re)writing the section (or brick) intro and recap should always be the last thing a curriculum writer does when writing a section. 

The naming convention for intro and recap is:

"dsc-section-recap-xxxxx" <br />
"dsc-introduction-xxxxx" 

with xxxxx being some wording related to the section name, eg the for the K Nearest Neighbors section you could write

"dsc-introduction-knn"  <br />
"dsc-section-recap-knn"
