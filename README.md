# dsc-curriculum-guidelines

This repository contains curriculum and style guidelines for the data science curriculum.

To learn what lesson types exist and what our repository structures look like, go to the [repository structure documemtation](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-curriculum-guidelines/blob/master/lesson_repository_structure.md).

An extensive style guide can be found [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-curriculum-guidelines/blob/master/style_guide.md).

To not confuse current batches of students, we create clones of existing repositories before altering them significantly. We'll consecutively create a new track. To learn how to make a copy for all branches purely using command line, [go here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-curriculum-guidelines/blob/master/cloning_repositories.md).

To copy your markdown text in juputer notebooks between branches, you can go here {Matts master merger comes here}
