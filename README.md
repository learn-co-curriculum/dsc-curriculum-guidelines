# Welcome to the DS Curriculum Guidelines Repository!

This repository contains guidelines and tooling for the data science curriculum.

## Structure and Style

See the `structure-and-style` directory for information about the different types of lessons in the DS curriculum as well as the curriculum writing style guidelines.

## Branch Splitter

All curriculum development work is done on the `curriculum` branch, then you use the branch splitter to copy the appropriate content to the `master` (and sometimes `solution`) branch. See the `master-solution-branch-splitter` directory for source code and instructions.

## Testing Code

Sometimes it is useful to be able to clone and execute all of the code in the curriculum (e.g. when you are testing out a new `conda` environment). The `testing-code` directory contains code and instructions for doing this.
