# Welcome to the Curriculum Guidelines Repository!

This repository contains curriculum and style guidelines for the data science curriculum.

To learn about the steps of the curriculum workflow for Curriculum V1, go to our [Curriculum V1 Workflow Document](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-curriculum-guidelines/blob/master/workflow_curriculum_v1.md).

If you want to know more about the existing lesson types, and what the respective repository structures look like, go to the [Repository Structure Document](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-curriculum-guidelines/blob/master/lesson_repository_structure.md).

An extensive style guide can be found [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-curriculum-guidelines/blob/master/style_guide.md).

To not confuse current batches of students, we create clones of existing repositories before altering them significantly. A new track will be created for curriculum V1. To learn how to make a copy for all branches purely using command line, go to our repository cloning documentation (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-curriculum-guidelines/blob/master/cloning_repositories.md).

To copy your markdown text in juputer notebooks between branches, you can go here {Matts master merger comes here}.
