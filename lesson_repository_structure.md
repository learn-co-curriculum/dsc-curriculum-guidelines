# Repository structure for DS lessons

## Lessons in repositories
There are three main types of flatiron lessons:

- Readme
- Lab
- Codealong

A **lesson** lives in a **github repository**. One repository can only contain one lesson. Repositories are created on the learn-co-curriculum organization and are set to **public**.

Each repository contains the following files (see template repositories below for the files):

- `.gitignore` 
- `.learn` 
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `LICENSE.md`
- `index.ipynb`
- `README.md` (This readme is being [generated using the Jupyter Notebook](#generating-readmemd-from-jupyter-notebooks)).
